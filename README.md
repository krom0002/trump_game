# Design Thoughts

Seperated the app.js file into two files for player and enemy. This helped me a lot.
Was having major brain block for this project and it almost broke me, lol. Dont know actually why, I think it was just a mental thing. After finishing it, I feel I have a better understanding of OOP and Canvas. I want to learn more.

The idea for Trump charecter was a joint brainstorming session with myself and 6 year old son.
He has a lot of ideas to enhance game play that may be implamented in future. He loves to play it as is also.
